1.) If given problems run killall node then restart server by cd'ing into back end
and running "npm run dev"

2.) If not sure if mongo is running type "sudo mongo" and input password. If you see
shell then it is running, you can also try connnecting to it from mongo compass and see
if that works

3.) *most ports are of type tcp some are udp but unusual
sudo lsof -i tcp:3000
//what is listening on port 3000

lsof -nP +c 15 | grep LISTEN
//what is listening on all ports (doesn't include mongo but default uses
port 27017)

sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep mongo
//this is the port that mongo is listening to, but usually, as stated above, it
runs on port 27017
